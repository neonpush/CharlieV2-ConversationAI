Charlie: Hi, is this John Smith?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Charlie: Great! I'm Charlie calling from Lobby about the property you enquired about. I need to confirm a few details before we can book your viewing. Do you have a moment?

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Charlie: Perfect! First, can I confirm your budget is around ¬£1,500 per month?

Customer: Actually, I can go up to ¬£1,800 per month.

Charlie: That's noted, ¬£1,800 per month. And you mentioned you're looking to move in early February?

Customer: Yes, February 1st would be ideal.

Charlie: Excellent. Can I ask what you do for work?

Customer: I'm a software engineer at a tech company.

Charlie: Great! And what's your annual income?

Customer: It's about ¬£65,000 per year.

Charlie: Perfect. And are you looking for a 6-month or 12-month contract?

Customer: I'd prefer a 12-month contract.

Charlie: Wonderful! All your details are confirmed. Now, when would you like to view the property? We have slots available this week.

Customer: How about Thursday at 2 PM?

Charlie: Thursday at 2 PM works perfectly! I'll send you a confirmation with the property address.

Customer: Sounds good, thank you!

Charlie: You're welcome! See you Thursday at 2 PM. Have a great day!
